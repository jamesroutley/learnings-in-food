## Ingredients

- 450g strong white flour
- 50g strong brown flour
- 10g instant yeast
- 10g salt
- 325g water

## Equipment

- Stand mixer
- 1kg loaf tin


## Process

1. Combine ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer
2. Knead until the dough comes together and feels smooth, about 10 mins
3. Add some olive oil to the bowl, and roll the dough in it to stop it drying out or sticking to the bowl
4. Cover bowl with a tea towel and let rise until it's doubled in size, around two hours
5. Pour dough out onto a floured work surface, shape into a log
6. Place log into loaf tin, seam side down
7. Cover with a tea towel and let rise for 1 hour. Meanwhile, heat oven to 220C and place a metal roasting tin the bottom
8. Fill the roasting tin with boiling water to create steam in the oven
9. Bake bread for 30 mins. It should sound hollow when you tap it on the base.
