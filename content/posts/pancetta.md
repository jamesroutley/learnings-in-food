I've got a couple of things planned, but this weekend I started making a rolled
pancetta, which I'm planning on letting cure for long enough that it's edible
raw. I'm following a recipe by Stephen Lamb in the River Cottage Handbook on
Curing and Smoking. I'll walk through the steps here, but there's a lot I can't
cover. If you'd like to learn more, I'd recommend reading this book.

Pancetta is pork belly, cured for a number of days before it's rolled and tied
into a cylinder, and air dryed until it's lost 30% of its weight, at which point
it's safe to eat raw. Let's look at the steps in detail.

## Preparing the pork

I started with a 1.8kg slab of pork belly, which I skinned and deboned. This
particular piece of pork was pre-scored, which isn't explicitly desirable, but
hopefully won't affect things negatively.

I've frozen the bones and skin, and will find a use for them later.

## Curing

I weighed the skinned and deboned pork, which came out at 1160g. I then mixed a
cure. The cure pulls moisture from the meat, and seasons it. This dehydration
and salting reduces the liklihood of the meat going off as it dries, (hopefully)
leaving us with a safe and shelf-stable product. My cure was made of:

- 58g salt (5% of the weight of the pork)
- 40g sugar (3.5% of the weight of the pork)
- 12.5g cracked black pepper
- 12g fennel seed, roughly broken up in a mortar and pestle
- 2 bay leaves (from the tree in the garden of the house I've recently moved
  into!), finely sliced

Of these, the amount of salt and sugar is important, and must be calculated as a
proportion of the weight of your pork. The rest are just to taste, and you can
do whatever you feel like.

Once the cure was mixed, I put the pork in a vacuum sealer bag, sprinkled half
the cure on either side, and vacuumed and sealed the bag. A vacuum sealer really
isn't necessary for this - I've cured successfully cured things in a large
Ziploc bag which I pressed the air out of.

This then rests in the fridge for six days per kilo, which came out as roughly
seven days for me.

## Rolling and tying

After seven days, I removed my pork from its bag, rinsed the residual cure off
it and dried it with a clean tea towel.

## A final note on failure
