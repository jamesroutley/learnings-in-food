## Ingredients

- 1 head napa cabbage (Chinese cabbage)
- salt

## Equipment

- A plastic or glass container of jar, large enough to fit the cabbage
- Digital weighing scales

## Process

1. Split the cabbage into quarters. I like to cut half nearest the stem with a knife, then tear the leaf half apart. 
2. Place the container on the weighing scales and tare it
2. Put the cabbage in the container, add just enough water to cover. The weigning scales now show the weight of the cabbage and the water
3. Calculate amount of salt you need. We're using 3% of the weight of the cabbage and the water. To find this, multiply the number on the weighing scale by 0.03
4. Remove the cabbage, add the salt, stir to dissolve, add the cabbage back
5. Weigh the cabbage down, so it's submerged
6. Leave at room temperature for two weeks, until the cabbage has lost some of its green colour and tastes sour, then move to the fridge
