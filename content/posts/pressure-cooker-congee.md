_Congee with chives, chilli oil, soy sauce and [fermented cabbage](/posts/brine-fermented-cabbage/)_

## Ingredients

- 1 cup long grain rice
- 9 cups water

## Equipment

- Pressure cooker

## Process

1. Combine rice and water, heat in pressure cooker
2. Once the pressure cooker reaches high pressure, cook for 20 minutes
3. Release the pressure quickly, and take the lid off
4. The congee will look watery. Whisk it till it reaches a consistency you like
5. Season, add toppings (see below)

## Variantions

I serve congee with a few toppings, usually made up from things I have in the
house. Some ideas:

- Meat - e.g. ground pork cooked with soy, ginger and garlic, shredded chicken, pork floss, [lap cheong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_sausage)
- Vegetables - e.g. spring onions, chives, corn, mushrooms
- Pickled or fermented vegetables - e.g. [fermented cabbage](/posts/brine-fermented-cabbage/), [ya cai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya_cai)
- Eggs - e.g. fried, boiled, preserved
- Sauces - e.g. chilli, soy
