Adapted from [this recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58uLaGS5iic)

## Ingredients

- 1kg lamb kneck, on the bone

- 2 onions, roughly chopped
- half a bulb of garlic, peeled
- 3 green chillies
- 5cm piece of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped

- 1 tbsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp red chilli powder
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 black cardamom
- 4 green cardamom
- 4 cloves

- 200g tomatoes, chopped
- 100g yoghurt

- Coriander
- Mint

## Process

1. Season the lamb. Brown it in a pan with a lid
2. Blend onion, garlic, chillies and ginger until smooth
3. Once the lamb is browned, remove it and add the blended onions etc
4. Cook over medium heat for 10 mins, stirring. You don't want to brown the onions
5. Add the spices, and return the lamb to the pan
6. Add the tomatoes and water to 3/4 way up the lamb pieces
7. Bring to the boil and simmer over low heat for two hours
8. Remove the lamb, pull the meat off the bones. It should pull easily
9. Add the yoghurt to the sauce, bring up to the boil and reduce it/add water to get the consistency you'd like
10. Return the lamb to the sauce, warm through then serve, topped with the coriander and mint
