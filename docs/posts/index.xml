      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s November. Here in the UK, autumn is in full swing, and the days are getting shorter and colder. This drop in temperature marks the beginning of the traditional time of year when people would cure meat. Meat from a freshly slaughtered animal deteriorates quickly, and curing it preserves it, and (no less importantly) enhances it.
Curing meat successfully and safely requires slow drying in a cool, draughty environment. Modern producers cure things in humidity and temperature controlled spaces which allow curing to take place year-round, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one of these setups, your best bet is to do things the old fashioned way.</description>
