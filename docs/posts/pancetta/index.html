<p>It&rsquo;s November. Here in the UK, autumn is in full swing, and the days are getting
shorter and colder. This drop in temperature marks the beginning of the
traditional time of year when people would cure meat. Meat from a freshly
slaughtered animal deteriorates quickly, and curing it preserves it, and (no
less importantly) enhances it.</p>

<p>Curing meat successfully and safely requires slow drying in a cool, draughty
environment. Modern producers cure things in humidity and temperature controlled
spaces which allow curing to take place year-round, but if you don&rsquo;t have one of
these setups, your best bet is to do things the old fashioned way.</p>

<p>Over the past week I started making a rolled pancetta, which I&rsquo;m planning on
letting air dry in my attic for long enough that it&rsquo;s edible raw. I&rsquo;ve cured
things before, but this is my first time trying a long air dry outside a fridge.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m following a recipe by Stephen Lamb in the River Cottage Handbook on Curing
and Smoking. At a high level:</p>

<ol>
<li>Skin and debone a piece of pork belly</li>
<li>Cure it in 5% salt, 3.5% sugar and spices to taste for 6 days per kg</li>
<li>Roll and tie it into a cylinder shape</li>
<li>Air dry in a cool, draughty place for 4-6 weeks, until it&rsquo;s lost 30% of its
weight</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ll walk through the steps here, but I&rsquo;m intending this to be a record of what
I&rsquo;ve done, rather than a definitive guide. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more, Stephen
Lamb has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cckRhgFmFkw">video of the process</a>,
and I&rsquo;d recommend reading the book. Curing meat can be dangerous, so please do
your own research and don&rsquo;t assume that things I&rsquo;m doing are necessarily safe.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-pork">Preparing the pork</h2>

<p>I started with a 1.8kg slab of pork belly. This particular piece of pork was
pre-scored, which isn&rsquo;t explicitly desirable, but hopefully won&rsquo;t affect things
negatively.</p>

<p>First I skinned the pork:</p>

    <img src="/img/pancetta/02.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>And then deboned it:</p>

    <img src="/img/pancetta/03.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>I&rsquo;ve frozen the bones and skin, and I&rsquo;ll find a use for them later.</p>

<h2 id="curing">Curing</h2>

<p>I weighed the skinned and deboned pork, which came out at 1160g. I then mixed a
cure. The cure pulls moisture from the meat, and seasons it. This dehydration
and salting reduces the likelihood of the meat going off as it dries,
(hopefully) leaving us with a safe and shelf-stable product. My cure was made
of:</p>

<ul>
<li>58g salt (5% of the weight of the pork)</li>
<li>40g sugar (3.5% of the weight of the pork)</li>
<li>12.5g cracked black pepper</li>
<li>12g fennel seed, roughly broken up in a mortar and pestle</li>
<li>2 bay leaves (from the tree in the garden of the house I&rsquo;ve recently moved
into!), finely sliced</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the amount of salt and sugar is important, and must be calculated as a
proportion of the weight of your pork. The rest are just to taste, and you can
do whatever you feel like.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/pancetta/04.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>Once the cure was mixed, I put the pork in a vacuum sealer bag, sprinkled half
the cure on either side, and sealed the bag. A vacuum sealer really isn&rsquo;t
necessary for this - I&rsquo;ve cured successfully cured things in a large Ziploc bag
which I pressed the air out of.</p>

    <img src="/img/pancetta/05.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>This then rests in the fridge for six days per kilo, which came out as roughly
seven days for me.</p>

<h2 id="rolling-and-tying">Rolling and tying</h2>

<p>After seven days, I removed my pork from its bag, rinsed the residual cure off
it and dried it with a clean tea towel. The pork itself is dryer to the touch
than it was before, and slightly tacky. This tackiness is known as a &lsquo;pellicle&rsquo;,
and if we were smoking our pancetta is what would allow the smoke to adhere.
Incidentally, the steps we&rsquo;ve followed up till now are identical to those for
making bacon - we could slice and cook and eat our pork as is.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/pancetta/06.jpeg"/> 
</figure>


<p>I spread the non-fat side of the pork with four crushed cloves of garlic, and
another 12.5g of cracked black pepper.</p>

    <img src="/img/pancetta/08.jpeg"/>

<p>Then, I rolled it. I was a bit unsure about which direction to roll - orienting
ourselves with the photo above, I could do it left-to-right to produce a
shorter, fatter cylinder, or top-to-bottom to give a longer thinner one.</p>

<p>In the end, I chose left-to-right. Our piece of pork belly is a section of a
full belly, which, before cutting, would have extended out from the top and the
bottom. Rolling left-to-right means if we were curing a whole belly, we&rsquo;d end up
with a roll of the same thickness, just longer. The thickness determines the
drying time, so aiming for a constant thickness irregardless of how much of the
whole belly you&rsquo;re curing felt reasonable to me.</p>

<p>After rolling, I secured it with a butcher&rsquo;s knot.
<a href="https://www.animatedknots.com/butchers-knot">This cute animation</a> shows how to
tie one, although I find using a figure 8 rather than an overhand in step 3 is
less prone to slipping.</p>

<p>I then tied more knots to keep the pancetta rolled.</p>

<h2 id="hanging-to-dry">Hanging to dry</h2>

<p>This is the scary bit. We need to hang the pork to air dry until it&rsquo;s lost 30%
of its weight, and will be safe to eat raw. I&rsquo;m hanging my pancetta in my attic,
which is draughty, and colder than the rest of the house (it was 13Â°C the time I
measured it, but that obviously changes with the outside temperature). To hang
it, I put a nail into one of the rafters, and tied the pancetta to it. I put a
plate underneath, to catch any drips.</p>

<p>While it dries I&rsquo;ll be checking it periodically. The things I&rsquo;ll check for are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A gradual decrease in weight as it dries. You want it to dry slowly. For the
centre to dry, water has to diffuse to the outside, where it evaporates. If
the outside dries too quickly, water won&rsquo;t be able to diffuse from the centre
and it won&rsquo;t dry properly. Incidentally, I think this is why we roll the
pancetta - the layer of fat on the outside controls the drying rate.</li>
<li>A bloom of white powdery mould, called <em>Penicillium</em>. It can be alarming to
see something mould, but this is desirable, and hopefully familiar - shop
bought salami frequently have a white colour, caused by this mould. In fact,
to encourage this mould to form, you can hang shop bought salami near the
thing you&rsquo;re curing.</li>
<li>Undesirable green orange or black moulds. If these form, I&rsquo;ll wipe them off
with a cloth dipped in vinegar.</li>
<li>Things that feel wrong. I&rsquo;m a believer in trusting your instincts when it
comes to food, and if something looks or smells bad and you don&rsquo;t want to eat
it, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now! I&rsquo;ll write a follow up post in a couple of months, where
we&rsquo;ll have pancetta, or something will have gone wrong. Either way we&rsquo;ll learn
something.</p>
